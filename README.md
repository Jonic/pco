You'll need the oscP5 library.

Custom Max Externals are also included in this release. If you're a Max user, this makes using PCO extremely easy.

This is rough&quick code that I wrote over a weekend a few years back when I was learning to program. I figure others might like to tinker with it, just be warned that my design is from when I was starting and is kind of clumsy. If I ever find myself expanding it, I'll rewrite it, likely with a more robust regard for threads. All that said, I've used the program a lot (including dozens of live performances) and have yet to experience a single crash.
